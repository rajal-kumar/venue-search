Recently I have been gaining motivation of challenging myself by building apps and improving my programming knowledge. So starting from the 14th of October 2019 I will be working on projects built with Node, Express and react. This will be a way of me showing consistency in building my knowledge and also having the ability to add more projects to my portfolio site. I hope you enjoy for whats to come :)
