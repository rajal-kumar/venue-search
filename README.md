# Venue Search app

I will be creating a simple app that will query the foursquare API for nearby venues based on a zip code and catergory entered by a user. This project will be built with React and Redux and will show how I will be integrating Redux and process data from API requests.

The structre of the app is built with the Facebook create-react-app by using the command npx create-react-app from the documentations. https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html


# Backstory

Recently I have been gaining motivation of challenging myself by building apps and improving my programming knowledge. So starting from the 14th of October 2019 I will be working on projects built with Node, Express and react. This will be a way of me showing consistency in building my knowledge and also having the ability to add more projects to my portfolio site. I hope you enjoy for whats to come :)
